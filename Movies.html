                    <dt>Howls Moving Castle:</dt>
                    <dd>Howl's Moving Castle will always have a special place in my heart as my dad showed it to me when I was a kid and <br>
                        we have continued to bond over movies alot throughout my life. It was the first Studio Ghibli film that I watched<br>
                        and it will always be my favorite. The worlds that Hayao Miyazaki creates are so intricate and beautiful they will<br>
                        draw you in and never let you go.</dd><br>
                    
                    <dt>Spirited Away:</dt>
                    <dd>Yet another of Hayao Miyazaki's masterpieces, Spirited Away is another one of my all time favorites. Maybe an even<br>
                        more beautiful world than the world of Howl's, Spirited Away is truly one of a kind. From the creepy corners to the<br>
                        majestic landscapes this film never ceases to amaze me no matter how many times I go back for more.</dd><br>

                    
                    <dt>Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back:</dt>
                    <dd>Now on to Star Wars. There is something about a world that seems never ending in its lore that entices me so. From<br>
                        an animated universe to a galaxy far far away it is these vast always growing worlds that I eat right up. Yes the<br>
                        Star Wars fandom can be extremely toxic (and I mean all the time!) but we can all unite under our common love for<br>
                        the lands and inhabitants of the Star Wars universe. There is just so much to be a fan of in Star Wars, from the vehicles,<br>
                        to the classic lightsabers, to the different characters and force abilities.</dd><br>
