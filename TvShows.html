                    <dt>One Piece:</dt>
                    <dd>I started watching One Piece earlier this year and it has become my favorite show already. Almost 400 episodes in <br>
                        and I still want more (thankfully for me there is over 600 episodes and the entire manga to go). Never did I think<br>
                        that I would be capable of watching a show that is over 1000 episodes long in it's entirety. Yet here I am. Of all<br>
                        the anime that I have watched this one is definitely the most fun. There are so many characters to love and so many<br>
                        ups and downs along the way, which will play with your emotions and have you feeling as if you were apart of the crew.<br>
                        What I enjoy the most though, is seeing how Luffy and his crew will overcome each new obstacle and each new ever<br>
                        increaisngly stronger enemy that stands in their path towards greatness. I always find myself yearning for the next<br>
                        adventure and the next big fight. </dd><br>

                    <dt>It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia:</dt>
                    <dd>A welcome break from all the Star Wars content and anime that I consume, Sunny never fails to make me laugh. Every<br>
                        character has the own comedic style and timing which makes for a great time. Whether it's Dennis being a psychopath<br>
                        or Frank being Frank I always know I can watch this show to get a laugh.</dd><br>

                    
                    <dt>Andor:</dt>
                    <dd>Out of all the live action Star Wars shows, Andor comes out on top. Even though there are no figurehead characters<br>
                        involved it keeps you engaged and craving more. I have watched all of the Mandolorian, Boba Fett, Obi-Wan, and Ahsoka.<br>
                        However, Andor had me on the edge of my seat and fully engaged till the bitter end!</dd><br>
