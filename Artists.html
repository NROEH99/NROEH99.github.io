                    <dt>Eminem:</dt>
                    <dd>Eminem was one of the very first musical artists I fell in love with and I have continued to love his music to this day.<br>
                        His lyrical ability along with his passion and skill with wordplay and freestyling hooked me in from a young age.</dd><br>
                    
                    <dt>Nas:</dt>
                    <dd>As I have grown and matured I started to listen to who the HipHop community said were the greatest. Nas is one of those mentioned<br>
                        first and formost. Nas's ability to combine sotry telling with music is unrivaled and the beats made by his producer Hit-Boy are<br>
                        one of a kind.</dd><br>

                    
                    <dt>Denzel Curry:</dt>
                    <dd>Denzel Curry is a newer face to the Hip-Hop genre and definitely a welecome one at that. Denzel's intesity and flare make him standout<br>
                        most to me yet he can still dial it back and have you mesmorized by his sound. As a younger talent I can definitely relate to him more<br>
                        as well.</dd><br>
